# Bullet Train REST API

## Development Environment

The following steps require an instance of postgres to be running locally on the default port (5432)  

```
pip install pipenv
pipenv install
pipenv shell
python src/manage.py migrate
python src/manage.py runserver
```

The application can also be run locally using Docker Compose if required, however, it's beneficial 
to run locally using the above steps as it gives you hot reloading. To run using docker compose, 
simply run the following command from the project root: 

```
docker-compose up
```

## Initialising
Once the app has been deployed, you can initialise it to create a super user by hitting the 
`/api/auth/init` endpoint. This will create a super user with the details configured in 
`app.settings.common` with the following parameters: 

```
ADMIN_USERNAME,
ADMIN_EMAIL,
ADMIN_INITIAL_PASSWORD
``` 

These can be updated before deployment, or equally, once initialised, you can log in and update 
these details.

## Databases
Databases are configured in app/settings/\<env\>.py

The app is configured to use PostgreSQL for all environments currently. 
NoSQL database systems will require some more complicated set up as Django is not 
designed for use with NoSQL databases.

When running locally, you'll need a local instance of postgres running. The easiest way to do this 
is to use docker which is achievable with the following command: 

```docker run --name local_postgres -d -P postgres```

You'll also need to ensure that you have a value for POSTGRES_PASSWORD set as an environment 
variable on you development machine.  

When running on a Heroku-ish platform, the application reads the database connection in production 
from an environment variable called `DATABASE_URL`. This should be configured in the Heroku-ish 
application configuration.  

When running using Docker, it reads the database configuration from the settings located at 
`app.settings.master-docker`

## Deploying

### Using Heroku-ish Platform (e.g. Heroku, Dokku, Flynn)
The application should run on any Heroku-ish platform (e.g. Dokku, Flynn) by simply adding the 
required git repo and pushing the code. The code for running the app is contained in the Procfile.

To get it running, you'll need to add the necessary config variables as outlined below. 

### Using Docker
The application can be configured to run using docker with simply by running the following command:

```
docker-compose up
``` 

This will use some default settings created in the `docker-compose.yml` file located in the root of 
the project. These should be changed before using in any production environments.

### Environment Variables
The application relies on the following environment variables to run: 

* `DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS`: comma separated list of hosts the application will run on in the given environment
* `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`: python path to settings file for the given environment, e.g. "app.settings.develop"
* `SENDGRID_API_KEY`: API key from sendgrid account which will need to be set up for emails to be sent from platform successfully
* `DATABASE_URL`: required by develop and master environments, should be a standard format database url e.g. postgres://user:password@host:port/db_name
* `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`: see 'Creating a secret key' section below

### Creating a secret key
It is important to also set an environment variable on whatever platform you are using for 
`DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`. There is a function to create one in `app.settings.common` if none exists in 
the environment variables, however, this is not suitable for use in production. To generate a new 
secret key, you can use the function defined in `src/secret-key-gen.py` by simply running it from a 
command prompt: 

```
python secret-key-gen.py 
``` 

## Adding dependencies
To add a python dependency, run the following commands:

```
pipenv install <package name>
```

The dependency then needs to be added to the relevant requirements*.txt files as necessary.
